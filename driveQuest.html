                                        <p>This is a larger scale project that I was apart of that was developed over the course of 
											2 semesters by the students in the Software Engineering courses SE300/310/320 at Chapman 
											University under Dr. Boyd and Professor Prate. The SRS document linked below has a detailed overview
											of the product with its parameters, requirements, and goals. Throughout these courses and
											time spent working on this project, I have learned about all aspects of the Software Development Cycle,
											and had the priveledge to see our team's work come to life on a real product that was published to the
											Apple App Store and is used as a tool in a professional work environment.

                                        Since this app is intended to run on mobile devices, our team built the app in React and
                                        used the services of Expo to demo the app on mobile devices. The current working version of the
                                        app can be tested with the ExpoGo app and with the QR code below.
