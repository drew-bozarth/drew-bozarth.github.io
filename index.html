									</header>
									<a href="driveQuest.html" class="image img"><img src="images/ExDriveQuest.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a larger scale project that I am apart of that is still in development.
									It is being developed over the course of 2 semesters by the students in the Software
									Engineering courses SE300/310/320. The SRS document linked below has a detailed overview
									of the product with its parameters, requirements, and goals. Throughout these classes and
									time spent working on this project, I have learned about all aspects of the Software Development Cycle,
									and had the priveledge to see our team's work come to life on a real product that will be delivered to a company.

									</header>
									<a href="https://drew-bozarth.github.io/236FinalProjectDEMO/" class="image img" target="_blank"><img src="images/ExStarWarsGalaga.png" alt="star wars" /></a>
									<p> I worked on this as my final project in an intro to Unity class with 3 other classmates.
									It is a fun game inspired by galaga but with a Star Wars twist! I learned a lot about creating
									a 2D game in a 3D space, and about implementing art and sounds into Unity games.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://drew-bozarth.github.io/my-sudoku-app/" target="_blank">Project 3<br />Sudoku App</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://drew-bozarth.github.io/my-sudoku-app/" class="image img" target="_blank"><img src="images/ExSudoku.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a personal project of mine that I decided to make out of my love for sudoku.
									I use a sudoku app on my phone almost everyday, but one feature I always sought after was
									a way for the user to input a puzzle, and have the app solve it for you. So I started by
									making a general sudoku playing app, then began to implement my ideas of having a secondary
									feature of a sudoku solver within the app.
									I learned a lot about Full Stack app creation and got more experience with React and using public npm libraries.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://drew-bozarth.github.io/BrickBusterDEMO/" class="image img" target="_blank"><img src="images/ExBrickBuster.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I made this game as an assignment in an intro to Unity class.
									It was inspired by the game Brick Buster, and has multiple levels to play through.
									It was a fun introduction to game and level design and it tought me a lot about
									the Unity game engine.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://drew-bozarth.github.io/PanthersVSPawsDemo/" class="image img" target="_blank"><img src="images/ExPanthersVSPaws.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I made as an assignment in an intro to Unity class.
									It is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played as Player vs Player, 
									or Player vs varying difficulties of AI. It was a great introduction to using the Unity
									engine to create games, and also tapped into creation of Artificial Intelligence for game opponents.</p>
